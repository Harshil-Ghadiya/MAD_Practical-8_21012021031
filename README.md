<b>Ans:-</b>

Broadcast in android is the system-wide events that can occur when the device starts, when a message is received on the device 
or when incoming calls are received, or when a device goes to airplane mode, etc. Broadcast Receivers are used to respond to
these system-wide events. Broadcast Receivers allow us to register for the system and application events, and when that event
happens, then the register receivers get notified.

Apps can use services to do long-running processes in the background, such as downloading files from a server, or checking for 
email, or checking your location. Although services don't show up or interact with you directly, they still show up in the "Running 
apps" list. Broadcast receivers are the third kind of component. Like services, they only exist in the background and don't interact 
with you directly. But unlike services, they can't stay running or perform long tasks: they exist to respond to events. And unlike
activities and services, more than one broadcast receiver can be started in one go.
